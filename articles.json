        "content": "<h3><b>HACKPINES CITY</b> â€” Last night, officials from the Democratic Republic of Hack Club unveiled its most ambitious project yet - a digital city under the name 'Hackpines'. The project itself is still under development but there seems to be much investment into the project prior to the announcement already.<br><br><i>''Hackpines is the first city ever in the Democratic Republic of Hack Club, but it still has a long way to go until fully deployed! That's why we need your help! Join us at <a href='https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08UC8C4AGZ'>#hackpines</a> to develop this city further by coding, writing history, geography, anything! This will be the biggest digital infrastructure project yet in the history of our nation, and once it's up and running, you'll be able to walk around, interact, and explore the city online!'' (Astra.Celestine)</i><br><br>From public information, the new city will offer an international airport supposedly named the Latta International Airport after the founder of Hack Club - Zach R. Latta. The city itself is a low-lying coastal city close to a few smaller islands to the east and forests and mountains inland. Hackpines is planned to be divided into 4 administrative regions and 15 districts.<br><br><table><tr><th>Administrative region</th><th>District</th></tr><tr><td rowspan='5'>Central Metropolitan Area</td><td>Latta District</td></tr><tr><td>Hacklyn District</td></tr><tr><td>Astral District</td></tr><tr><td>Kay District</td></tr><tr><td>Orphean Heights</td></tr><td rowspan='4'>Outer Metropolitan Area</td><td>Hackridge District</td></tr><tr><td>Orpheion District*</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow District</td></tr><tr><td>Cyrillic District</td></tr><td rowspan='3'>The Pines</td><td>Meow District</td></tr><tr><td>Hackmarsh District</td></tr><tr><td>Celestial District</td></tr><td rowspan='3'>Coastal Area</td><td>La Mer District</td></tr><tr><td>Hackbay District</td></tr><tr><td>Trashbeard District</td></tr></table><br><br>There also appears to be plans by members of Parliament to turn the future Hackpines city into the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Hack Club, relocating main government buildings and offices to the Central Metropolitan Area. Regardless, this is a large step forward for the future of the D.R. Hack Club.</h3>"
